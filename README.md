## Overview

The HRMS backend is a crucial component of the HRMS web application, responsible for managing and processing employee information and supporting various human resource functions such as benefits, payroll, recruiting, and training. This documentation outlines the technologies, methodologies, and processes employed in the development and maintenance of the HRMS backend.

## Technologies Utilized

### Backend Technologies

- **Spring Boot**: The core framework for building the backend application, providing features such as auto-configuration and convention over configuration.
- **Spring Framework**: Utilized for dependency injection and inversion of control.
- **Hibernate ORM**: Object-Relational Mapping tool used for mapping Java objects to database tables.
- **RESTful APIs**: Implemented using Spring MVC to provide communication between the frontend and backend.
- **JUnit**: Employed for unit testing to ensure code reliability and robustness.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Used for simplifying data access with Java Persistence API.
- **Mockito**: Utilized for mocking dependencies during unit testing.
- **Spring IOC**: Implemented for managing object dependencies.

### Frontend Technologies

- **Angular**: Framework utilized for building dynamic frontend web pages.
- **Bootstrap**: Employed for responsive and mobile-first web design.
- **npm**: Package manager used for installing and managing frontend dependencies.
- **HTML, CSS, TypeScript**: Languages used for structuring, styling, and scripting the frontend.

### Database

- **MySQL**: Relational Database Management System utilized for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **SQL**: Language used for querying and managing the database.

### Tools

- **GitHub**: Utilized for version control, allowing collaboration and monitoring among team members.
- **Visual Studio Code, Eclipse**: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) used for coding and debugging.
- **Postman**: Employed for testing RESTful APIs.
- **Swagger**: Utilized for documenting and testing APIs.
- **Spring Tool Suite (STS)**: IDE utilized for Spring application development.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool used for managing project dependencies.
- **Angular CLI**: Command-line interface utilized for Angular application development.

## Development and Maintenance Processes

- **Backend Development**: The HRMS backend was developed using Spring Boot, Spring Framework, and Hibernate ORM in Java. Database schemas were designed and built in MySQL, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.
  
- **Unit Testing**: Concurrently with development, unit tests were created and executed using JUnit to ensure code reliability and robustness. This was carried out in adherence to Agile methodologies, promoting iterative development and testing.

- **Frontend Integration**: Dynamic frontend web pages were released using Angular, HTML, CSS, and TypeScript to provide a seamless user experience.

- **Version Control and Deployment**: Source code and project files were deployed using GitHub, ensuring version control and monitoring among team members. Continuous integration and deployment pipelines were established to automate the deployment process.

- **Code Reviews and Refactoring**: Regular code reviews were conducted among developers to maintain code quality and consistency. Refactoring was performed as necessary to improve code readability, maintainability, and performance.

## Conclusion

This documentation provides an overview of the development and maintenance processes involved in building the HRMS backend for a private client project. While specific files and code snippets cannot be provided due to confidentiality reasons, abstract descriptions of the technologies, methodologies, and processes utilized have been outlined for reference.
